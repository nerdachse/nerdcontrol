#Nerdcontrol

A very simple (and my first) Android application for controlling [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) via [OBS-websocket](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket)

### Regarding [OBS-websocket](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket)

At the time of creating this, obs-websocket v5 (a complete rewrite) is not yet officially released. 

The latest release is
https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/releases/tag/5.0.0-beta1
You have to manually build it and install it for your OBS Studio.

#### The new protocol is vastly different to v4. _This application only supports v5_
